To complete the PWA setup, please add the following PNG icons to this directory:

1. `icon-192.png`
   - Size: 192x192 pixels
   - Format: PNG
   - Purpose: Used for app icons on Android and other platforms

2. `icon-512.png`
   - Size: 512x512 pixels
   - Format: PNG
   - Purpose: Used for high-resolution displays and splash screens

3. `apple-touch-icon.png`
   - Size: Recommended 180x180 pixels
   - Format: PNG

These files are referenced in the `manifest.json` and are essential for proper PWA functionality across different platforms.
